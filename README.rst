Material database
=================

This repository has properties for different groups of material. The main idea
is to provide accessible properties for comparison. References for the material
properties are provided in the file ``materials_references.bib``.

Files format
------------

Right now the properties are stored in Tab Separated Value files (``.tsv``)
for simplicity. They are not a robust solution, but they can be easily imported
in Python and JavaScript scripts. For material properties, minimum and
maximum values are provided in common units.


Collaboration
-------------

If you want to add properties for materials in some of the groups you can
check the format and units in the corresponding file. The references should
go in ``materials_references.bib`` and the bibtex-key should go in the field
for references of the file.
