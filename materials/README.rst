Common materials
-------------------

This is a list of common materials with a broad classification. It is
useful for general purposes.

Biological mateials
-------------------

This is a list of biological materials, as the one that constitute tissues
for animals or plants.


Anisotropic materials
---------------------

These lists present `elastic properties <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hooke%27s_law#Hooke's_law_for_continuous_media>`_
for materials with different symmetry classes.

Monoclinic
~~~~~~~~~~

Monoclinic materials present a symmetry plane and have 13 independent
elastic constants.

In the database, the axis orthogonal to the symmetry plane of the material
is aligned with the :math:`x_1` coordinate.

Orthotropic materials
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`Orthotropic materials <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthotropic_material>`_
present three orthogonal planes of symmetry. Thus, the number of independent
elastic constants are 9.

In the database, the axes orthogonal to the symmetry planes of the material
are aligned with the coordinate system.


Trigonal materials
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Trigonal materials are monoclinc materials that also present symmetry
with respecto to planes rotated 60° with respect to the symmetry plane.
For this materials 6 independent constants are needed.

In the database, the axis orthogonal to the symmetry plane of the material
is aligned with the :math:`x_1` coordinate.

Tetragonal materials
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Tetragonal materials are orthotropic materials that also present symmetry
with respecto to planes rotated 45° to one of the symmetry planes.
For this materials 6 independent constants are needed.

In the database, the axes orthogonal to the symmetry planes of the material
are aligned with the coordinate system.

Transversely isotropic materials
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`Transversely isotropic <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transverse_isotropy>`_
materials present a symmetry axis that is normal to a plane of isotropy. The
stiffness tensor is formed by 5 different parameters in this case.

In the database, the symmetry axis of the material is aligned with the
:math:`x_3` coordinate.

Cubic
~~~~~

`Cubic materials <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubic_crystal_system>`_ are the
simplest since they only have 3 parameters to describe the whole stiffness
tensor.

In the database, the symmetry axes of the material are aligned with the
coordinate system.
