Progress in the development of surgical implant materials has been hindered by the lack of basic information on the nature of the tissues, organs and systems being repaired or replaced. Materials' properties of living systems, whose study has been conducted largely under the rubric of tissue mechanics, has tended to be more descriptive than quantitative. In the early days of the modern surgical implant era, this deficiency was not critical. However, as implants continue to improve and both longer service life and higher reliability are sought, the inability to predict the behavior of implanted manufactured materials has revealed the relative lack of knowledge of the materials properties of the supporting or host system, either in health or disease. Such a situation is unacceptable in more conventional engineering practice: the success of new designs for aeronautical and marine applications depends exquisitely upon a detailed, disciplined and quantitative knowledge of service environments, including the properties of materials which will be encountered and interacted with. Thus the knowledge of the myriad physical properties of ocean ice makes possible the design and development of icebreakers without the need for trial and error. In contrast, the development period for a new surgical implant, incorporating new materials, may well exceed a decade and even then only short term performance predictions can be made.},

  abstract  = {Driven by the increasing economic burden associated with bone injury and disease, biomaterial development for bone repair represents the most active research area in the field of tissue engineering. This article provides an update on recent advances in the development of bioactive biomaterials for bone regeneration. Special attention is paid to the recent developments of sintered Na-containing bioactive glasses, borate-based bioactive glasses, those doped with trace elements (such as Cu, Zn, and Sr), and novel elastomeric composites. Although bioactive glasses are not new to bone tissue engineering, their tunable mechanical properties, biodegradation rates, and ability to support bone and vascular tissue regeneration, as well as osteoblast differentiation from stem and progenitor cells, are superior to other bioceramics. Recent progresses on the development of borate bioactive glasses and trace element-doped bioactive glasses expand the repertoire of bioactive glasses. Although boride and other trace elements have beneficial effects on bone remodeling and/or associated angiogenesis, the risk of toxicity at high levels must be highly regarded in the design of new composition of bioactive biomaterials so that the release of these elements must be satisfactorily lower than their biologically safe levels. Elastomeric composites are superior to the more commonly used thermoplastic-matrix composites, owing to the well-defined elastic properties of elastomers which are ideal for the replacement of collagen, a key elastic protein within the bone tissue. Artificial bone matrix made from elastomeric composites can, therefore, offer both sound mechanical integrity and flexibility in the dynamic environment of injured bone.},

  abstract  = {Some ceramics, such as BioglassÂ®, sintered hydroxyapatite, and glass-ceramic A-W, spontaneously bond to living bone. They are called bioactive materials and are already clinically used as important bone substitutes. However, compared with human cortical bone, they have lower fracture toughness and higher elastic moduli. Therefore, it is desirable to develop bioactive materials with improved mechanical properties. All the bioactive materials mentioned above form a bone-like apatite layer on their surfaces in the living body, and bond to bone through this apatite layer. The formation of bone-like apatite on artificial material is induced by functional groups, such as Siâ€“OH, Tiâ€“OH, Zrâ€“OH, Nbâ€“OH, Taâ€“OH, â€“COOH, and PO4H2. These groups have specific structures revealing negatively charge, and induce apatite formation via formations of an amorphous calcium compound, e.g., calcium silicate, calcium titanate, and amorphous calcium phosphate. These fundamental findings provide methods for preparing new bioactive materials with different mechanical properties. Tough bioactive materials can be prepared by the chemical treatment of metals and ceramics that have high fracture toughness, e.g., by the NaOH and heat treatments of titanium metal, titanium alloys, and tantalum metal, and by H3PO4 treatment of tetragonal zirconia. Soft bioactive materials can be synthesized by the solâ€“gel process, in which the bioactive silica or titania is polymerized with a flexible polymer, such as polydimethylsiloxane or polytetramethyloxide, at the molecular level to form an inorganicâ€“organic nano-hybrid. The biomimetic process has been used to deposit nano-sized bone-like apatite on fine polymer fibers, which were textured into a three-dimensional knit framework. This strategy is expected to ultimately lead to bioactive composites that have a bone-like structure and, hence, bone-like mechanical properties.},

  Abstract                 = {Amazon Review --------------------- Ultrasonic non-destructive evaluation (NDE) plays an increasingly important role in determining properties and detecting defects in composite materials, and the analysis of wave behavior is crucial to effectively using NDE techniques. The complexity of elastic wave propagation in anisotropic media has led to a reliance on numerical methods of analysis-methods that are often quite time-consuming and whose results yield even further difficulties in extracting explicit phenomena and characteristics. Innovative and insightful, Elastic Waves in Anisotropic Laminates establishes a set of high-performance, analytical-numerical methods for elastic wave analysis of anisotropic layered structures. The treatment furnishes a comprehensive introduction, sound theoretical development, and applications to smart materials, plates, and shells. The techniques, detailed in both the time and frequency domains, include methods that combine the finite element method (FEM) with the Fourier transform approach and the strip element method (SEM). These -methods can also be used for expediently finding the Green's function for anisotropic laminates useful for inverse problems related to wave propagation, and methods for inverse analyses, including conjugate gradient methods, and genetic algorithms are also introduced. The text is complemented by many examples generated using software codes based on the techniques developed. Filled with charts and illustrations, Elastic Waves in Anisotropic Laminates is accessible even to readers from non-engineering backgrounds and offers a unique opportunity to discover methods that can lead to an understanding of the dynamic characteristics and wave motion behaviors of advanced composite materials.},

By assuming that the piezoelectric stress is proportional to the charge density on the electrodes rather than the potential gradient as usually assumed, theoretical frequencies are obtained which agree with those found experimentally. This theoretical derivation together with the measured frequencies supply values for the piezoelectric constants. The elastic constants measured dynamically show some differences from those measured statically. A large difference is found for the dynamically measured piezoelectric constants from those statically measured, which may be attributed to the finite relaxation time for the piezoelectric elements.},

  Abstract                 = {Most natural (or biological) materials are complex composites whose mechanical properties are often outstanding, considering the weak constituents from which they are assembled. These complex structures, which have risen from hundreds of million years of evolution, are inspiring Materials Scientists in the design of novel materials.
Their defining characteristics, hierarchy, multifunctionality, and self-healing capability, are illustrated. Self-organization is also a fundamental feature of many biological materials and the manner by which the structures are assembled from the molecular level up. The basic building blocks are described, starting with the 20 amino acids and proceeding to polypeptides, polysaccharides, and polypeptidesâ€“saccharides. These, on their turn, compose the basic proteins, which are the primary constituents of â€˜soft tissuesâ€™ and are also present in most biominerals. There are over 1000 proteins, and we describe only the principal ones, with emphasis on collagen, chitin, keratin, and elastin. The â€˜hardâ€™ phases are primarily strengthened by minerals, which nucleate and grow in a biomediated environment that determines the size, shape and distribution of individual crystals. The most important mineral phases are discussed: hydroxyapatite, silica, and aragonite.
Using the classification of Wegst and Ashby, the principal mechanical characteristics and structures of biological ceramics, polymer composites, elastomers, and cellular materials are presented. Selected systems in each class are described with emphasis on the relationship between their structure and mechanical response. A fifth class is added to this: functional biological materials, which have a structure developed for a specific function: adhesion, optical properties, etc.
An outgrowth of this effort is the search for bioinspired materials and structures. Traditional approaches focus on design methodologies of biological materials using conventional synthetic materials. The new frontiers reside in the synthesis of bioinspired materials through processes that are characteristic of biological systems; these involve nanoscale self-assembly of the components and the development of hierarchical structures. Although this approach is still in its infancy, it will eventually lead to a plethora of new materials systems as we elucidate the fundamental mechanisms of growth and the structure of biological systems.

  comment   = {"The exact theoretical description of transient wave motion in transversely anisotropic media is the focus of this monograph. Compactly presented are analyses of the wave front motion caused by point sources in two and three-dimensional unbounded media and half-spaces. Because various topics and mathematical techniques are brought together for the first time, the monograph may interest theoretical engineers and applied mathematicians in several distinct disciplines. The monograph has five short chapters. In the first chapter the author reviews the basic linearized equations of motion of a transversely isotropic solid and emphasizes the meaning and consequences of the strong ellipticity constraint on the independent stiffness constants. In the next chapter, he uses the theory of characteristics to analyse the wave front motion caused by a point source in an unbounded medium. This analysis is accompanied by numerous tables detailing classes of possible behavior and by equally numerous figures illustrating the wave front and normal curves for these classes and for common hexagonal crystals. The variety of wave front shapes found in these tables emphasizes the complexity of the wave motion in transversely isotropic materials. The third chapter, the longest, economically presents a derivation of the displacement field Green's tensor in an unbounded two-dimensional medium (and along the symmetry axis in three dimensions) by integral transform techniques. The existence of an explicit solution for this problem is significant since Green's tensors are generally known only for the simplest problems. The remaining two chapters of the monograph concentrate on the transversely isotropic version of Lamb's problem in two dimensions and on the epicenter and epicentral motion in threedimensional half-spaces. Because of the mathematical emphasis and the specialized topic, the monograph will be most accessible to experienced theorists and applied mathematicians. Generally, it may be a useful reference and source book." JAMES E. GUBERNATIS Los Alamos National Laboratory Los Alamos NM 87545 U.S.A.},

  abstract  = {Propagation and reflection of plane elastic waves in the acousto-optic crystals tellurium dioxide, rutile, barium titanate, and mercury halides are examined in the paper. The reflection from a free and flat boundary separating the crystals and the vacuum is investigated in the (001) planes in the case of glancing acoustic incidence on the boundary. The analysis shows that two bulk elastic waves may be reflected from the crystal surface. The energy flow of one of the reflected waves in paratellurite and in the mercury compounds propagates in a quasi-back-direction with respect to the incident energy flow. It is proved that energy flows of the incident and reflected elastic waves are separated by a narrow angle of only a few degrees. It is also found that the relative intensity of the unusually reflected waves is close to a unit in a wide variety of crystal cuts. General conclusions related to acoustic propagation and reflection in crystals have been made based on the examined phenomena in the materials.},

  Abstract                 = {In 1995, the International Association for the Properties of Water and Steam (IAPWS) adopted a new formulation called â€œThe IAPWS Formulation 1995 for the Thermodynamic Properties of Ordinary Water Substance for General and Scientific Useâ€?, which we abbreviate to IAPWS-95 formulation or IAPWS-95 for short. This IAPWS-95 formulation replaces the previous formulation adopted in 1984. This work provides information on the selected experimental data of the thermodynamic properties of water used to develop the new formulation, but information is also given on newer data. The article presents all details of the IAPWS-95 formulation, which is in the form of a fundamental equation explicit in the Helmholtz free energy. The function for the residual part of the Helmholtz free energy was fitted to selected data for the following properties: (a) thermal properties of the single-phase region ($p\rho T$) and of the vaporâ€“liquid phase boundary ($p_\sigma \rho' \rho'' T$), including the phase-equilibrium condition (Maxwell criterion), and (b) the caloric properties specific isochoric heat capacity, specific isobaric heat capacity,speed of sound, differences in the specific enthalpy and in the specific internal energy, Jouleâ€“Thomson coefficient, and isothermal throttling coefficient. By applying modern strategies for optimizing the functional form of the equation of state and for the simultaneous nonlinear fitting to the data of all mentioned properties, the resulting IAPWS-95 formulation covers a validity range for temperatures from the melting line (lowest temperature 251.2 K at 209.9 MPa) to 1273 K and pressures up to 1000 MPa. In this entire range of validity, IAPWS-95 represents even the most accurate data to within their experimental uncertainty. In the most important part of the liquid region, the estimated uncertainty of IAPWS-95 ranges from Â±0.001% to Â±0.02% in density, Â±0.03% to Â±0.2% in speed of sound, and Â±0.1% in isobaric heat capacity. In the liquid region at ambient pressure, IAPWS-95 is extremely accurate in density (uncertainty <=Â±0.0001%) and in speed of sound (Â±0.005%). In a large part of the gas region the estimated uncertainty in density ranges from Â±0.03% to Â±0.05%, in speed of sound it amounts to Â±0.15% and in isobaric heat capacity it is Â±0.2%. In the critical region, IAPWS-95 represents not only the thermal properties very well but also the caloric properties in a reasonable way. Special interest has been focused on the extrapolation behavior of the new formulation. At least for the basic properties such as pressure and enthalpy, IAPWS-95 can be extrapolated up to extremely high pressures and temperatures. In addition to the IAPWS-95 formulation, independent equations for vapor pressure, the densities, and the most important caloric properties along the vaporâ€“liquid phase boundary, and for the pressure on the melting and sublimation curve, are given. Moreover, a so-called gas equation for densities up to 55 kg?m-3 is also included. Tables of the thermodynamic properties calculated from the IAPWS-95 formulation are listed in the Appendix},

  abstract  = {The functional requirements for synthetic tissue substitutes appear deceptively simple: they should provide a porous matrix with interconnecting porosity and surface properties that promote rapid tissue ingrowth; at the same time, they should possess sufficient stiffness, strength and toughness to prevent crushing under physiological loads until full integration and healing are reached. Despite extensive efforts and first encouraging results, current biomaterials for tissue regeneration tend to suffer common limitations: insufficient tissueâ€“material interaction and an inherent lack of strength and toughness associated with porosity. The challenge persists to synthesize materials that mimic both structure and mechanical performance of the natural tissue and permit strong tissueâ€“implant interfaces to be formed. In the case of bone substitute materials, for example, the goal is to engineer high-performance composites with effective properties that, similar to natural mineralized tissue, exceed by orders of magnitude the properties of its constituents. It is still difficult with current technology to emulate in synthetic biomaterials multi-level hierarchical composite structures that are thought to be the origin of the observed mechanical property amplification in biological materials. Freeze casting permits to manufacture such complex, hybrid materials through excellent control of structural and mechanical properties. As a processing technique for the manufacture of biomaterials, freeze casting therefore has great promise.},

Contrary to previous molecular dynamics simulations, our calculations revealed that the most stable state structure of pristine PEDOT is monoclinic. We calculated the 13 independent elastic constants and the elastic compliance which enables us to establish other elastic properties of pristine PEDOT; the Pugh’s ratio and the Vicker’s hardness computed with PBE and PBEsol are in good agreement with each other. Finally, we compute the directional elastic modulii and found remarkable differences between different DFT functionals.},
