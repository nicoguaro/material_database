# Material database

This repository has properties for different groups of material. The main idea
is to provide accessible properties for comparison. References for the material
properties are provided in the file `materials_references.bib`.

## Files format

Right now the properties are stored in Tab Separated Value files (.tsv)
for simplicity. They are not a robust solution, but they can be easily imported
in Python and JavaScript scripts. For material properties, minimum and
maximum values are provided in common units.


## Collaboration

If you want to add properties for materials in some of the groups you can
check the format and units in the corresponding file. The references should
go in `materials_references.bib` and the bibtex-key should go in the field
for references of the file.
